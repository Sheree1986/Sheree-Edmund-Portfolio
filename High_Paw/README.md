## Action 

<details>
🐾 In this team of four, I was worked with Adrian on the Frontend. We mainly peer coded. My main contribution to the project was Using the DOG API to render the fact page and creating the profile page. Refactoring code and implementing the basic structure for the frontend. Adrian is the mastermind that build upon the structure to create the user interact and visible appealing design. 


🐾 Worked collaborated with the backend (Patrick and Kharmalina) to connect the login and registration routes. 

🐾 Focused on debugging an issues with deleting the refresh token upon user logout.

🐾 Attempted to implement frontend testing. Unfortunately testing on .jsx files were a blocker.
