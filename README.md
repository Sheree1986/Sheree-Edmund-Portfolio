## Portfolio Introduction

Hi ^_^ I'm Sheree. Currently completing my 12 months Software Engineering Apprenticeship at Verizon. After discovering I am an individual with Autism, I took some time to examine my career and what meshes with my special interest. Solving problems and puzzles are my zen place. Coding and software engineering as a whole allows me to find that zen, while utilizing my need to use logic to solve issues. Join the Thrive Apprenticeship program at Verizon allowed me the space to learn and grow. The fact that this is a career that you are always learning something new and the tech is always transforming will allow me to be a lifelong student.

During the apprenticeship I worked on the following teams:
- **Strawberry-Inventory-App**: Kris, Lavor
- **S.A.S. Travels**: Back for More: Adrian, Sharee
- **My Hero Academia**: Igmer, Sharee
- **High-Paw**: Patrick, Kharmalina, and Adrian

At Verizon I am part of the IOP team that supports the switch engineers here at Verizon. During the apprenticeship I was able to learn about the IOP Switch Module and how it helps switch engineers do their jobs to build/maintain our network. I started working with the Shapeshifters Scrum Team within Network Assurance ART. (Agile Release Train). There I gained an understanding of how the Agile process works. From the Agile ceremonies to gathering requirements and to how we design and develop the solutions into production.
